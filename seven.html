    <p>hey, my love, happy 7th monthiversary to us! i'm so happy that we made it this far, and i’m so proud of our journey together, my love!</p>

    <p>i'm happy to be in this relationship, and i enjoy every moment we spend together, as we created so many memories.</p>

    <p>grabe, love, tagal na natin and, of course, mas tatagal pa 'to! our relationship will never come to an end. i’m still grateful that you made the first move, love.</p>
	<p>dapat thankful kasi lagi ako sayo nag iinitiate before, sobrang cold mo sa’kin dati, love. pero look at us now, love,</p>
	<p>kung ano ano na nagagawa natin, lagi na nagpapa kiss, nagpapa lambing, tapos away nang away (syempre ikaw nang aaway). </p>
	<p>we’ve been through a lot of ups and downs. we learned so much from our arguments and misunderstandings, and from those ups, we created such joyful memories.</p>
	<p>            </p>
	<p>love, i know most of the time lagi mo akong inaaway (joke lang) sorry if often times i act so childish and immature.</p>
	<p>i know at some point i’ve been a bad boyfriend to you, and i have no excuses. </p>
	<P>i’m really sorry for all the wrong doings that i have done. i promise to make up for those and i will do better!</p>
	<p>i will be better for you, my love! (di na me mag susungit:3(lambing lang naman kasi gusto ko)) </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>love, i will never stop telling how much i love you! you are such an amazing person. you make so proud and happy, my love.</p>
	<p>i want you to remember that every time you feel sad or you’re going through a lot,</p>
	<p> i will be here for you palagi. i will be with you every step of the way, tandaan mo yan! i care for you so much, my love.</p>
	<p>you are the best thing that ever happened in my life, i’m so happy that i have an amazing girlfriend,</p>
	<p>you really deserve an award for being the best girlfriend in this entire universe! You deserve everything, my love. </p>
	<p></p>
	<p>i love you so so so much, mahal ko. i hope for us to learn more from this relationship while we grow old together!</p>
	<p> mag tatapos tayo and magiging mayaman, we will achieve all of our dreams together and we will live happily. we will prove all of them wrong.</p>
	<p>cheers to more months and memories, my love! my home! my friend! my family! my everything! my one and only casseophea!</p>
	<p>HAPPY 7TH MONTHSARY, MY LOVE!!!!!</p>
